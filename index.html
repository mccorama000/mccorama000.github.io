         <h3>Bio</h3>
         <p>I am a student at Eastern Washington University. I am currently on track to get my degree in Visual Communication Design, and a minor in Business. Coming to Eastern was not far from home for me, as I was born and raised in Spokane, Washington, and have lived in the same house since I was born. I discovered my passion for Graphic Design at the STEM school that I attended in high school, Riverpoint Academy. </p>  
         
         <h3>Professional Objectives</h3>
         <p>I'm not entirely sure what I want to pursue a career in yet, however I have really enjoyed the advertising and logo/branding design work that I have done in my courses thus far. I am very new to Web Design, but so far I have really enjoyed that as well.</p>
